	! Firefox decided render shadow much bigger then supposed to
1.28.2 (2018-02-07)
	! in Firefox shadow would show on opened show when popup was opened
1.28.1 (2018-02-07)
	+ shadow on "popups", making them more pronounced
1.28 (2018-02-04)
	+ search by adding #s:keyword in the address
	+ changes log
	+ ability use hash tags as links in comments (<a href="#s:test">#s:<i>search-keyword</i></a>, <a href="#info:1234">#info:<i>NN</i></a>, <a href="#myshows">#myshows</a>, <a href="#hidden">#hidden</a>, <a href="#changes">#changes</a>). Without ADE it will open a blank page.
	+ option for small logo
	! disqus troll would not work at all in some browsers
	! disqus troll would not work on additionally loaded comments
	! "watched" checkboxes shown through search field
	! close button on popups would not work if cursor not in the middle of it
	* removed disq.us from links in comments
	* links in comments open in new tab
	* when searching via hash tag, clearing search field with X icon would also remove the hash tag from address bar
1.27.5 (2018-01-22)
	! broken fix for paste via right click in search bar
1.27.4 (2018-01-22)
	+ cloud icon next to member name
1.27.3 (2018-01-22)
	! fails initialize with some invalid colors in cookies
	* replaced some icons with SVG, should now be more browser independent and consistent
1.27.2 (2018-01-21)
	! sorting by color with fallback to sorting by name was in reverse
1.27 (2018-01-21)
	+ link to support website
	! middle click on title would attempt open 2 tabs for each selected link
	! significantly improved initialization speed for guests and members with no colors (very noticeable with #showhidden in the address)
